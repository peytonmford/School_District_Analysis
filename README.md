# School District Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to show the school board all the schools statistics, including the school type, size, average math and reading scores, passing math and reading percentages, and overall percentage passing. Another purpose of this analysis was to show the budgets and per student budget and how we can allocate it better per student. 
## Results
### District Summary
The district summary did not change, as you can see on the images taken. The reason is because the Thomas High School ninth graders were suspected of academic dishonesty and were taken out.
