# School District Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to show the school board all the schools statistics, including the school type, size, average math and reading scores, passing math and reading percentages, and overall percentage passing. Another purpose of this analysis was to show the budgets and per student budget and how we can allocate it better per student. 
## Results
### District Summary
The district summary did not change, as you can see on the images taken. The reason is because the Thomas High School ninth graders were suspected of academic dishonesty and were taken out.

### School Summary
The school summary budgets were the biggest change. The total budget increased, thus individual school's budgets were increased. We were able to categorize the school's size to allocate more money to the bigger sized schools, to increase the budget per student. Replacing the ninth graders scores at Thomas High School dramatically decreases THS' scores.
